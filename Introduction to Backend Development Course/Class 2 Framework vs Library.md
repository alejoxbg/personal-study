Frameworks and Libraries.They are not the same

They are the tools to build the backend offrontend application, as the machine who builds thea car 

You can build everything from scrach but that has no sence thats why there are libreries, there are pieces of code to do a specific task but a framework is a group of libreries, rules and standars to build a digital product

FastAPI, Django and flask are frameworks

Pandas, numpy, matplotlib are libreries
