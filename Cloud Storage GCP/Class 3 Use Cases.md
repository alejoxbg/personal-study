The objects are assosiated to buckets, the buckets are asosiated to projects ande the projects to a organization.

The security is really important, with cloud storage you can manage the permissons to each objects, all the data is cypted when is stored or when is consulted. You can have a retention capability to guarantee that the file will remain in the time even 10 years or more. Also there is a control version of all the files.

The crypto keys with a robust algorithm and the key is a critic process and we need to have mechanism that organice this keys, GCP can handle the keys in all the process. You can also use the key control system of GCP or you have a key managment , with that you can have the best obtion to have security of all the data.
